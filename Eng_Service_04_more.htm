								<font color="#CC6699"><strong>About homestay</strong></font><br />
								<span class="style2"><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Is it safe to do a homestay with us?</strong><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.Each family is interviewed by our staff, and a security 
																		check is completed before a family is accepted. The housing units are usually 
																		owned (not rented) by the host families, and most hosts have professional 
																		careers. <br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Will I have my own room?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Every family has at least one spare room. <br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What items will be in my room?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your room is fully furnished with a bed, desk, wardrobe (or 
																		closet) and air-conditioning. <br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Will I get meals?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakfast and dinner are included in the regular homestay. If 
																		you apply for free homestay, some families may offer breakfast & dinners, some 
																		may not. It depends on each family's conditions.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>May I make my own food? </strong>
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, with the host family's permission.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I am a vegetarian, is that a problem?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry. We have a few host families who are vegetarians 
																		too. Please specify this with your application and we can arrange either a 
																		vegetarian family or a vegetarian friendly family for you. <br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Can I use the host family's telephone?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may make local telephone calls for short conversation 
																		from the homestay. All long distance calls should be made using a calling card. 
																		If you would like to have your own telephone number, you can register for one 
																		at a cost of RMB 235 (about US $28). Your host family will assist you in doing 
																		this.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>May I use the family computer to get access to the 
																			Internet?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Each family have computer at home. If there is ADSL, it 
																		will be free for you to get access to the Internet. If you need to log-on to 
																		the Internet, you will need to get the family's permission first.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>May I smoke in the house?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but only with the permission of the host family. Some 
																		host families will ask that you smoke outside the unit.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Can I do laundry in the Homestay?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. The host family will show you where the laundry 
																		facilities are.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Will I be able to watch television?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. All the living facilities in the public area of unit 
																		will be available to you.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Will I have a curfew (time that I need to return to the 
																			Homestay each night) ?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will not have a curfew. However, it is customary that you 
																		notify your host family if you will miss dinner or will return to the house 
																		after 10pm. For other rules you should obey in homestay, please read Rules of 
																		the homestay<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Can I have guests come to the homestay? </strong>
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, with the host family's permission.<br />
																		<br />
																		<!--Begin: +more -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Can I join the family's activities?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the hosts treat you as a family member and welcome you 
																		to join their activities.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Is a married couple eligible to apply for your homestay 
																			program?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, married couples are welcome to join our program as most 
																		of our families are open to couples. Please note that the homestay fee for 
																		couples is 50% more than for a single person.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What is the communication language at my host family?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your host family understands that your purpose to come to 
																		China is for Chinese language learning, therefore, they will communicate with 
																		you in Chinese at home. If you apply for a free homestay, you have the 
																		responsibility of teaching the family English for one hour a day. The rest of 
																		the time you can speak Mandarin to the family. Many families will be happy to 
																		tutor you Chinese and help you to improve your conversation skills.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What if my Chinese is not good enough to communicate with 
																			the family?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry. Most of our families can speak a bit of English. 
																		If you can't understand what they are saying in Chinese, ask them to explain it 
																		in English.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How many hours of social time can I expect to have with 
																			my host family?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It depends on the type of family you stay with. A young 
																		couple's family is usually only available after working hours and on weekends. 
																		If the family is senior retired people or the hostess is a housewife, you can 
																		expect more time to communicate with them. A lot of families will be willing to 
																		invite you to join their activities during the weekends, which is a good way to 
																		socialize with the family.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Can I get assistance and help from my host family?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely. Your host family will be happy to provide all the 
																		necessary info and first hand help during your stay.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What if I can't get along well with my host family?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not happy with your host family after arrival in 
																		China , we can change one family relocation for you. If you can't get along 
																		with the new family, it's your responsibility to make a decision about your 
																		accommodation. In our experience, this does not happen often. As both sides are 
																		well educated and patient when it comes to cultural differences, most of our 
																		students and host families get along very well and even make life-long 
																		friendships.<br />
																		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How far will the homestay be away from school?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The families near campus are located either walking distance 
																		or within 30 minutes by public transportation in non-peak time to the campus. 
																		Please note that the location of families in free homestay listing may not be
